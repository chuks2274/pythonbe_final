## app.py
### What This File Does
This file is responsible for **starting the Flask application** and **initializing the database tables** when the application is run. It uses the `create_app` function (following the Flask application factory pattern) and SQLAlchemy for database management.
When executed directly, this file:
**Creates the Flask application** using `create_app()`.
**Pushes the application context**, allowing database operations to be performed.
**Initializes all database tables** defined in the application's models.
**Starts the Flask development server** with debugging enabled.

## config.py
### What This File Does
This file defines the **configuration settings** for the Flask application, including database connections, caching, and security keys.

### Loads Environment Variables 
Reads values from a `.env` file to configure sensitive settings like the database URL and secret keys.

### Defines the Config Class
Holds all configuration options for the Flask application in a single class (`Config`).

### Database Configuration  
Uses `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to specify the database connection string.
Disables `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` to save memory and avoid unnecessary overhead.

### Security Key
Sets a `SECRET_KEY` used by Flask for securely signing sessions and other cryptographic operations.
If not provided in the environment, a default key (`supersecret`) is used.

### Caching Configuration 
Sets `CACHE_TYPE` to `"SimpleCache"` to enable in-memory caching for improved performance.

## models.py
### What This File Does
This file defines the **database models** and **association tables** for managing customers, mechanics, service tickets, and inventory in the application. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM to map Python classes to database tables.

### Association Tables

`service_mechanic` 
A many-to-many relationship between service tickets and mechanics.  
Allows multiple mechanics to be assigned to a single service ticket.

`service_inventory` 
A many-to-many relationship between service tickets and inventory items.  
Allows multiple inventory parts to be linked to a single service ticket.

### Models

`Customer`
Represents a customer in the system.  
Key attributes include `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, and `password`.  
Has a **one-to-many** relationship with `ServiceTicket` (a customer can have multiple service tickets).

`Mechanic`
Represents a mechanic with attributes such as `name`, `specialty`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, and `salary`.  
Has a **many-to-many** relationship with `ServiceTicket` through the `service_mechanic` table.

`ServiceTicket`
Represents a service request or repair job.  
Attributes include `description` and `customer_id`.  
Linked to **customers**, **mechanics**, and **inventory parts** via relationships:
Many-to-one with `Customer`.
Many-to-many with `Mechanic`.
Many-to-many with `Inventory`.

`Inventory`
Represents items or parts available for use in repairs.  
Attributes include `name`, `sku`, `description`, and `price`.  
Has a **many-to-many** relationship with `ServiceTicket` through the `service_inventory` table.

## extensions.py
### What This File Does
This file is responsible for **initializing the core Flask extensions** used throughout the application. These extensions provide database management, serialization, caching, request limiting, and database migrations.

### Database Management (`db`) 
Sets up SQLAlchemy, the Object Relational Mapper (ORM), for interacting with the database using Python classes and objects.

### Serialization (`ma`)  
Initializes Marshmallow, which handles object serialization and deserialization (e.g., converting Python objects to JSON and vice versa).

### Caching (`cache`)  
Configures a simple in-memory cache (`SimpleCache`) to improve performance by temporarily storing frequently accessed data.

### Rate Limiting (`limiter`) 
Sets up request rate limiting using client IP addresses as identifiers.
By default, limits each client to **100 requests per hour** to prevent abuse.

### Database Migrations (`migrate`)  
Enables database schema migrations using Flask-Migrate, which is built on top of Alembic.
Allows smooth database schema updates without losing existing data.

## __init__.py
### What This File Does
This file defines the **Flask application factory** function, `create_app()`, which is responsible for creating and configuring the Flask app instance. It sets up extensions, configuration, and routes (blueprints).

### Create the Flask Application
A new Flask app instance is created when `create_app()` is called.
Configuration settings are loaded from the `Config` class.

### Initialize Extensions
**Database (SQLAlchemy):** Enables ORM-based database interactions.
**Serialization (Marshmallow):** Handles data serialization and validation.
**Migrations (Flask-Migrate):** Manages database schema changes without losing data.
**Caching:** Sets up application-level caching for performance optimization.
**Rate Limiting:** Controls the rate of incoming requests to prevent abuse.

### Register Blueprints
**Mechanic Blueprint (`/mechanics`):** Handles all mechanic-related API routes.
**Customer Blueprint (`/customers`):** Manages endpoints for customer operations.
**Service Ticket Blueprint (`/service-tickets`):** Handles service ticket creation and management.
**Inventory Blueprint (`/inventory`):** Provides endpoints for managing inventory items.

### Return the App
Returns the fully configured Flask application instance, ready to be run by the server (e.g., in `app.py`).

## pagination.py
### What This File Does
This file provides a helper function to **paginate SQLAlchemy query results** and return them in a standardized JSON format.

### paginate_query(query, schema, default_per_page=10)  
Handles pagination for large datasets, making it easier to display results across multiple pages in API responses.

### Pagination Parameters:
Reads `page` and `per_page` from the query parameters of an HTTP request.  
Defaults to page `1` and `10` items per page if not specified.

### Query Execution: 
Uses the provided SQLAlchemy query object to fetch the requested page of data.  
Ensures that missing or invalid page values don't result in errors.

### Serialization: 
Uses the provided Marshmallow schema to serialize the paginated results into JSON format.

### JSON Response:
Returns a structured JSON response containing:
`items`: Serialized data for the current page.
`total`: Total number of items.
`pages`: Total number of available pages.
`current_page`: The current page number.

## auth.py
### What This File Does
This file provides functions and decorators for **JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication** to secure API endpoints.

### encode_token(user_id) 
Generates a JWT token containing the userâ€™s ID and an expiration time.
The token expires **1 hour** after being generated.
Encodes the payload using the application's `SECRET_KEY` and the HS256 algorithm.
**Use Case:**  
Typically called during login to issue a token for authenticated requests.

### token_required(f) 
A decorator that protects routes by requiring a valid JWT token.
**How It Works:**  
Checks for a token in the `Authorization` header (format: `Bearer <token>`).
Validates and decodes the token.
Extracts the `user_id` from the token payload and passes it to the wrapped function.
Returns appropriate error responses for:
Missing tokens (`401 Token is missing`).
Expired tokens (`401 Token expired`).
Invalid tokens (`401 Invalid token`).

### Security
The `SECRET_KEY` is loaded from environment variables (with a default fallback).
Token expiration ensures that old tokens cannot be reused indefinitely.

# Customer Blueprint Initialization

### __init__.py
### What This File Does
This file sets up the **Blueprint** for all customer-related routes in the Flask application.
